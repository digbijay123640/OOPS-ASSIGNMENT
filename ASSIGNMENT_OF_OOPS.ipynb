        "###1.What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "  >Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which can contain data (in the form of fields, often called attributes or properties) and methods (functions that operate on the data). OOP is designed to improve code reusability, scalability, and maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "###2.What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "  >Class: The class is a user-defined data structure that combines the methods and data members into a single entity. For the production of objects, classes serve as blueprints or code templates. You can make as many objects as you desire using a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "###3.What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "  >An instance of a class is an object. It consists of a set of methods and attributes. Actions are carried out using a class's object. Objects have two qualities: They exhibit states and actions. (The object is equipped with properties and methods) Methods represent its behaviour, while attributes represent its state. We can alter its status by using its techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "###4.What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "  >Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details of a system from the user, and only the functional details will be available to the user end. On the other hand, Encapsulation is a method of wrapping up the data and code acting on the data into a single unit.\n",
        "\n",
        "###5.What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "  >Dunder methods, also known as magic methods or special methods, in Python are special reserved methods that are surrounded by double underscores (i.e., method). These methods allow you to define how instances of your classes behave when they are used with built-in Python functions or operators. Understanding dunder methods is crucial for creating custom objects that behave like built-in types or implementing operator overloading in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "###6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "  >Inheritance plays a significant role in an object-oriented programming language. Inheritance in Python refers to the process of a child class receiving the parent class's properties. The reuse of code is inheritance's main goal. Instead of starting from scratch when developing a new class, we can use the existing class instead of re-creating it from scratch.\n",
        "\n",
        "###7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "   >In OOP, polymorphism refers to an object's capacity to assume several forms. Simply said, polymorphism enables us to carry out a single activity in a variety of ways From the Greek words poly (many) and morphism (forms), we get polymorphism. Polymorphism is the capacity to assume several shapes.\n",
        "\n",
        "###8.How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "   >Encapsulation can be achieved by Declaring all the variables in the class as private and writing public methods in the class to set and get the values of variables. It is more defined with the setter and getter method.\n",
        "\n",
        "###9.What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "   >In Python, a constructor is a special method that is called when an object is created. Its purpose is to assign values ​​to data members within the class while initializing the object. The name of the constructor method is always init.\n",
        "\n",
        "###10.What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "   >A class method can access or modify the class state, whereas a static method cannot access or modify it. Generally, static methods do not have any knowledge about the class state. They are utility-type methods that take some parameters and operate on them. On the other hand, class methods must have the class as a parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "###11.What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "   >Method overriding in Python occurs when a child class defines a method that has the same name and parameters as a method in its parent class. The child class method overrides or replaces the parent class method when called on an instance of the child class.\n",
        "\n",
        "###12.What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "  >Method overriding is a mechanism in OOP that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. In other words, when a subclass defines a method with the same name and signature as a method in its superclass, it overrides the behavior of that method.\n",
        "\n",
        "###13.What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "   >The decorator is a built-in Python decorator that allows you to turn class methods into properties in a way that's both elegant and user-friendly.\n",
        "\n",
        "###14.Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "  >Polymorphism is used in OOP to allow developers to write more efficient code and redefine methods for derived classes; however, it could raise real-time performance issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "###15.What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "   >Abstract classes can specify properties that subclasses must implement in addition to methods. This feature enables developers to impose a uniform interface for properties that subclasses must declare in addition to methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "###16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "   >OOPs simplifies software development by organizing code into reusable, modular, and scalable components. Its features, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, improve code maintainability, security, and efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "###17.What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "   >Class Variable: Shared among all instances of a class, defined outside      methods inside the class, and modified at the class level.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Instance Variable: Unique to each instance, defined inside the init method, and modified per object.\n",
        "\n",
        "###18.What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "  >Multiple inheritance allows classes to inherit and combine the behavior of multiple parent classes, providing flexibility in designing complex class hierarchies. However, it’s important to carefully consider the design and potential complexities that can arise when using multiple inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "###19.Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        "  >str(self): This method is called when the str() function is used on an instance of the class. It should return a string representation of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "  repr(self): This method is called when the repr() function is used on an instance of the class. It should return an unambiguous string representation of the object, which can be used to recreate the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "###20.What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "  >We use functions in programming to bundle a set of instructions that you want to use repeatedly or that, because of their complexity, are better self-contained in a sub-program and called when needed. That means that a function is a piece of code written to carry out a specified task.\n",
        "\n",
        "###21.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "  >The del method exists to release any resources held by an object when that object is deleted. The del is called only by the garbage collector which may call it after an indefinite delay or never. Consequently, del method should not be relied on to release resources, such as file descriptors.\n",
        "\n",
        "###22.What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "  >The main difference between static and instance methods is: Static method: This method belongs to the class and can be called without creating an object. Instance method: This method belongs to an object and requires an object to be called.\n",
        "\n",
        "###23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "  >Polymorphism allows different classes to use the same method name but execute different behaviors. In inheritance, polymorphism enables a child class to override a method from the parent class while keeping the method name the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "###24.What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "  >Method chaining refers to calling multiple methods sequentially on the same object in a single expression. Each method call returns an object, often the same object (modified or not), allowing the subsequent method to operate on that object.\n",
        "\n",
        "###25.What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "  >call() is to turn your instances into callable objects. In other words, its purpose is to create objects that you can call as you would call a regular function. Most Python classes don't implement this method. Your custom classes will have it only if you need to use your instances as functions.\n",
